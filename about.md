Future extensions:
    - back-testing sentiment analysis model
    - create an accompanying low-latency (C++) trading framework, to support HFT (high frequency trading)
    
Learnt:
    Handling multiple data streams (market data API, database, web scraping)
    Using Ajax to retrieve data from the server asynchronously, in real time
    
Points of discussion:
    The thing I love most about this project is that there is always scope for continuous improvement - you can be very creative
